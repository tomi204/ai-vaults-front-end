# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Vaults

> **Advanced DeFi vault system with AI-driven strategy execution and multi-chain support**

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

AI-Powered Vaults is a sophisticated DeFi protocol that combines traditional ERC4626 vault functionality with AI-driven strategy execution. The system allows users to deposit assets into vaults while AI agents automatically optimize yield through whitelisted strategies including swaps, lending, and other DeFi protocols.

## Why does SPQRFi use off-chain AI agents?

Off-chain yield farming analysis allows for a level of intelligence and adaptability that on-chain systems simply can't match. AI agents operating off-chain have access to real-time data from across the web â€” including market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and on-chain analytics â€” giving them a broader and more accurate decision-making base.

They also benefit from advanced computational resources: high-speed processors, complex machine learning models, and constant upgrades, all without the limitations of gas fees, blockchain latency, or smart contract rigidity.

The result? Smarter, faster, and more effective strategies that evolve with the market. SPQRFi harnesses this power to seek, compare, and execute the best DeFi opportunities for you â€” securely, intelligently, and with zero friction.
