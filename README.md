## Why does SPQRFi use off-chain AI agents?

Off-chain yield farming analysis allows for a level of intelligence and adaptability that on-chain systems simply canâ€™t match. AI agents operating off-chain have access to real-time data from across the web â€” including market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and on-chain analytics â€” giving them a broader and more accurate decision-making base.

They also benefit from advanced computational resources: high-speed processors, complex machine learning models, and constant upgrades, all without the limitations of gas fees, blockchain latency, or smart contract rigidity.

The result? Smarter, faster, and more effective strategies that evolve with the market. SPQRFi harnesses this power to seek, compare, and execute the best DeFi opportunities for you â€” securely, intelligently, and with zero friction.
