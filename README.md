# 🤖 SPQRFi

> **Advanced DeFi vault system with AI-driven strategy execution and multi-chain support**

![SPQRFi DeFAI Super Vaults](header.gif)

## 📋 Overview

SPQRFi is a sophisticated DeFi protocol that combines traditional ERC4626 vault functionality with AI-driven strategy execution. The system leverages a deterministic AI system (SPQR Agent) that monitors and executes strategies across Flow and Rootstock ecosystems, implementing cross-protocol yield optimization with LLM-based planning and multi-layered risk assessment.

### Key Features

- **SuperVaults**: Specialized liquidity pools that aggregate user deposits and prepare them for deployment
- **AI-Driven Strategy**: Automated investment decisions based on real-time yield and risk analysis
- **User Dashboard**: Real-time portfolio monitoring and performance tracking
- **Automated Rebalancing**: AI-managed portfolio adjustments for optimal yields
- **Risk Management**: Dynamic risk assessment and mitigation with Allora Network
- **Multi-signature Security**: Safe integration for secure transaction approval
- **Gas-Optimized Execution**: Transactions only execute when yield improvements exceed gas costs
- **Protocol-Agnostic Architecture**: Compatible with lending markets, AMMs, liquid staking, and more

The SPQR Agent is our deterministic AI system that:

### Core Capabilities
- Monitors and executes strategies across Flow and Rootstock ecosystems
- Implements cross-protocol yield optimization
- Uses LLM-based planning for strategy generation
- Employs multi-layered risk assessment
- Executes approved strategies with multi-sig security

### Risk Assessment System

1. **Protocol Risk**
   - TVL monitoring
   - Liquidity depth analysis
   - Smart contract risk scoring
   - Historical pattern matching

2. **Market Risk**
   - Volatility tracking
   - Price impact analysis
   - Slippage protection
   - Liquidation risk assessment

3. **Execution Risk**
   - Gas optimization
   - Transaction sequencing
   - Multi-sig verification
   - Rate limiting

### Security Features
- **Deterministic Execution**: No randomness in strategy generation
- **Multi-sig Protection**: All transactions require multiple signatures
- **Risk Scoring**: Every strategy is scored before execution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous protocol health checks
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Automatic response to unusual events
- **Fund Security**: Agent has no direct access to funds, only updates contract state
- **Off-chain Analysis**: Combines on-chain and off-chain data for comprehensive risk assessment

## 🌐 Live Deployment

SPQRFi is currently live on Flow and Rootstock with active DeFi strategies that are automatically allocating capital based on AI-driven analysis.

**Live Demo:** [https://spqrfi.vercel.app/](https://spqrfi.vercel.app/)

## Why does SPQRFi use off-chain AI agents?

Off-chain yield farming analysis allows for a level of intelligence and adaptability that on-chain systems simply can't match. AI agents operating off-chain have access to real-time data from across the web — including market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and on-chain analytics — giving them a broader and more accurate decision-making base.

They also benefit from advanced computational resources: high-speed processors, complex machine learning models, and constant upgrades, all without the limitations of gas fees, blockchain latency, or smart contract rigidity.

The result? Smarter, faster, and more effective strategies that evolve with the market. SPQRFi harnesses this power to seek, compare, and execute the best DeFi opportunities for you — securely, intelligently, and with zero friction.
